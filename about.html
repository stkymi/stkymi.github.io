title: About Ruoyu Sun
---

I build stuff: code, software, product, business and team in investment banking and technology (or *fintech* if you will). Currently I lead the [product and as well as the team](https://alpha.huaxing.com/), both of which I built from scratch. I love writing code, even though I don't get to code as I would like at work. I make up for that by playing with all kinds of cool techs at home.

I have lived in Hong Kong since 2008 and attended [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk) with a degree in Business (and two minors in Computer Science and Statistics). I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/insraq) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ruoyu-sun/27/6b6/b8). I can also be reach by email *hi AT ruoyusun DOT com*
